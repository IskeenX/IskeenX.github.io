                    One of the hardest schools to get into. I was an A+ student, focusing on **Deep Mathematics, Algebra, and Geometry**. 
                    We learned multiplication in **2nd grade**, and I had one of the best teachers in Kyrgyzstan. 
                    This school shaped my love for calculations and logical thinking.
