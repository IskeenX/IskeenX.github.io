            <h3>Gymnazium School №70</h3>
            <p>
                One of the hardest schools to get into. I was an <strong>A+ student</strong>, focusing on **Deep Mathematics, Algebra, and Geometry**.  
                We learned multiplication in **2nd grade**, and I had one of the best teachers in Kyrgyzstan.  
                This school shaped my love for **calculations & logical thinking**.
